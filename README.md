# :hourglass_flowing_sand: time-series-forecasting-wiki
This repository contains a series of analysis, transforms and forecasting models frequently used when dealing with time series. The aim of this repository is to showcase how to model time series from the scratch, for this we are using a real usecase dataset ([Beijing air polution dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Beijing+PM2.5+Data) to avoid perfect use cases far from reality that are often present in this types of tutorials.

The dataset used is the [Beijing air quality](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Beijing+PM2.5+Data) public dataset. This dataset contains polution data from 2014 to 2019 sampled every 10 minutes along with extra weather features such as preassure, temperature etc. We decided to resample the dataset with daily frequency for both easier data handling and proximity to a real use case scenario (no one would build a model to predict polution 10 minutes ahead, 1 day ahead looks more realistic). In this case the series is already stationary with some small seasonalities which change every year #MORE ONTHIS

We will devide our results wether the extra features columns such as temperature or preassure were used by the model as this is a huge step in metrics and represents two different scenarios. Metrics used were:

## Evaluation Metrics
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE) 
* Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* Coefficient of determination (R2)

## Univariate models


## Multivariate models
